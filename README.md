# telecom-customer-churn-prediction
End-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn with a Flask API and Streamlit dashboard.


Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn
refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a company. By predicting
churn, telecom companies can take proactive steps to retain customers by offering personalized
offers, improving service quality, and reducing revenue loss

Methodology:
1. Loading the Data: Imported the dataset into Python using pandas. 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA): Performed descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to understand
patterns. 3. Data Preprocessing: Converted categorical features into numerical values, handled
missing data, and applied feature scaling. 4. Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training (80%)
and testing (20%) subsets. 5. Model Building: Built a Logistic Regression model to predict churn. 6.
Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and
classification report.

Results and Findings:
The Logistic Regression model provided predictions of customer churn with a measurable
accuracy. The confusion matrix and classification report highlighted how well the model classified
churn vs. non-churn customers. This demonstrates that predictive analytics can help telecom
companies reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.

Conclusion:
This project successfully implemented a machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn. It
showcased the end-to-end workflow including data loading, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and
evaluation. The model can be further improved with advanced algorithms like Random Forests,
Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks, but Logistic Regression provides a strong and interpretable
baseline solution
